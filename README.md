Red Dead Redemption - Detailed Game Map V2.0
===================
![RDR_DetailedGameMap_Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JFlynnXYZ/RDR_DetailedGameMap/master/02_export/RDR_DetailedGameMap_V2.0_Banner.png)

This is a detailed **Red Dead Redemption™** map that was created from a wide range of sources from the original Rockstar® game. The work was initially completed by Jonny Flynn (JFlynnXYZ) and Version 2.0 was made Creative Commons on 2020/07/17. 

File Information
-------------

### 01_source
Contains the source Illustrator file used to create the final exports. 
>**`RDR_DetailedGameMap.ai`**
>
> **Illustrator File Version**: Illustrator 2020 (Compatible with Illustrator 24 and above)
> 
> **Notes:** 
> - The file is designed to be A3 and printed at 300ppi. The project is entirely vector so you can print to any size quality.
> - All icons are using dynamic symbols for ease of replacement
> - Background is using a auto-traced image of the RDR background to create lossless quality prints. Some fidelity in the terrain has been lost in doing this and should be cleaned up.
> - The road and paths (sadly) got expanded on the original file and I don't have a backup of the direct paths meaning they are straight up shapes. It would be good to trace over them all again but honestly, I don't have time anymore :c I started doing this work in the sub layer `LINEMARKINGS>REWORK`
> - File has a 40mm bleed for canvas printing.
> - This file can also be opened in Adobe Reader if you don't have Illustrator
### 02_export/scripts
Contains some export scripts from the Illustrator file to be used for speeding up exporting of the illustrator files. Currently very WIP but still useful to look at

TODO
-------------
- Re-trace all the paths/roads to be easily editable
- Clean up river and border edges to match the map better
- Add region lines (surrounding Rio Bravo, Cholla Springs etc.)
- Add detailed hideout building areas
- Add missing random location buildings dotted around
- Translations
--Please get in touch if you want to translate the map and send them over and I can upload them alongside the English one.
